    "# Mini Project: Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare from DataCamp\n",
    "Setting: A pharmaceutical company GlobalXYZ has just completed a randomized controlled drug trial. To promote transparency and reproducibility of the drug's outcome, they (GlobalXYZ) have presented the dataset to your organization, a non-profit that focuses primarily on drug safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided contained five adverse effects (headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), demographic data, vital signs, lab measures, etc.), demographic data, vital signs, etc. The ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1. Your organization is primarily interested in the drug's adverse reactions. It wants to know if the adverse reactions, if any, are of significant proportions. It has asked you to explore and answer some questions from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the dataset has been modified to reflect the presence and absence of adverse effects adverse_effects and the number of adverse effects in a single individual num_effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the modified dataset are:\n",
    "Sex:\t                (The gender of the individual), \n",

    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs significantly between the Drug and Placebo groups, saving the p-value as a variable called two_sample_p_value\n",
    "* To find out if the number of adverse effects is independent of the treatment and control groups, saving as a variable called num_effects_p_value containing a p-value.\n",
